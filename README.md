# Module 6: World Weather Analysis

## Purpose and Overview 
The purpose of this project is to assist in the creation of a "PlanMyTrip" app by adding a "weather description" 
feature that allows customers to view the current weather of potential travel destination in conjunction with the other
travel and weather data and to provide an example itinerary.

__This project has 3 deliverables__:

* *Deliverable 1*: includes of a data frame exported as a [csv](https://github.com/laurlen2112/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Del%201%20CSV.png) containing:
	* Latitude and longitude of potential destinations
	* Maximum temperature of potential destinations
	* Percent humidity of potential destinations
	* Percent cloudiness of potential destinations
	* Wind speed of potential destinations
	* Weather description of potential destinations

* *Deliverable 2*: consists of a [csv](https://github.com/laurlen2112/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/del%202%20csv.png) that is [filtered on the basis of minimum and maximum temperatures](https://github.com/laurlen2112/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Del%202%20code%20box.png) of potential travel destinations and an [example weather map with location information](https://github.com/laurlen2112/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/WeatherPy_vacation_map%20copy.png).

* *Deliverable 3*: contains the example travel itinerary of a multi-stop vacation showing a [travel map](https://github.com/laurlen2112/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/WeatherPy_travel_map%20copy.png) between locations and a [destination map](https://github.com/laurlen2112/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers_large%20copy.png) that includes markers showing the vacation destinations, city and hotel information, and relevant  weather data.
